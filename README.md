# PS3 Voice and Graphics Patch (in progress)

Currently hosting only the automated placed lines. All files need manual fixing, avoid placing them on your game.

README's going to be updated as the patch is developed. Refer to our [wiki](https://07th-mod.com/wiki) for more details about the patch.

Old collaborators welcome to join the repository, however it's still preferred to fork the repository and update through pull requests while the initial voice matching process is ongoing.

# Scripts progress

>Bold lines means "in progress"
